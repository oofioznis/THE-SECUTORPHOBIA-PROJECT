Secutorphobia - The Fear of Being Followed.
A more subtle and atmospheric take on the horror modpack genre. Unlike most modpacks which add many diverse mobs and hard to kill entities, this modpack is more focused on a vanilla+ experience wih added horror.

## Features!

- More biomes and structures to explore, adding more reason to leave your home and explore.
- Lots of options for building your home! All of Macaw's mods, and Biomes O' Plenty adding a bunch of wood types.
- Expanded weapons! You won't be stuck with a sword and axe against the horrors of the night.
- An immersive environment with sound physics and ambient noises to keep you paranoid!
- Voice chat, with added radio communications for long distance communication. Build the radiotower of your dreams!
- Essentials mod to simplify playing with friends. Nobody wants to waste hours setting up a dedicated server.
- Multiple, not overly intrusive creatures:
  - Cave Dweller
  - Man From The Fog
  - The Knocker
  - Herobrine
  - ...

## Recommendations
- 5-6 gigabytes of assigned RAM for a smooth experience.
- Using Hysteria shaders (The modpack still works without them, though for best experience it is recommended.)
- Keep brightness minimal, nights being hard to navigate is an intended feature, torches are your friend.
- The Ability to read, which you seem to have! Bravo.
